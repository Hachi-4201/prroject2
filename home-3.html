  <div class="module3">  Honda has a variety of eco friendly cars, many also being fairly affordable to own and buy.
 One amazing example is the Honda Clarity. The Hoinda Clarity is a zero emissions hydrogen and electric car,
 the hybrid and electric versions are less expensive and definfetly worth the money with its features, however the hydrogen model is
 much more expensive but really cool and efficent in the long run. These cars are very low emission vehicles and are proven to use less fuel than a lot of other vehicles.
